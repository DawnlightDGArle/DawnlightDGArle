ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DawnlightDGArle, Iâ€™m interested in computer science, programming and web development.
Iâ€™m currently learning HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript/Processing 4.
I am currently enrolled as a Computer Science major at a 4 year university.

Most of my GitHub repositories will likely be private since I mostly just program for myself
and will use GitHub as a way to store and organise my repositories as I work on them from a
local machine, so if you'd really like to see some of my works, feel free to ask and I'll at least
consider the request c':
