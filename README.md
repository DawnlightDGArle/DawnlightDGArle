ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m @DawnlightDGArle or you can just call me Dawnlight! Iâ€™m interested in computer science, programming and web development as well as retro video games (especially the PC-98), late 80s, 90s and early 2000s things and Japanese puzzle video games!

Iâ€™m currently learning HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript/Processing 4 after I dipped my toes into both the discord.py library in early 2019 and Scratch 3.0 in 2017 and got my first tastes in programming through those things throughout the years.
Nowadays, I am currently enrolled as a Computer Science major at a 4 year university and so far, I have been having so much fun with Computer Science and I find myself always trying to learn more about it just for the heck of it nowadays.

Most of my GitHub repositories will likely be private for the time being since I mostly just program for myself
and will use GitHub as a way to store and organise my repositories as I work on different programming projects here and there, so if you'd really like to see some of my works, feel free to ask and I'll at least consider the kind request c':
